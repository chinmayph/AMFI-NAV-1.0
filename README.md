This code aims to scrape the NAV data from AMFI website and save it in an excel file. The ultimate aim is to scrape the data directly from the website. But as of now, I haven't figured that out properly. So, I will be downloading a text file from the URL and then working on it.
The URL for the same is - 'https://www.amfiindia.com/spages/NAVAll.txt'
